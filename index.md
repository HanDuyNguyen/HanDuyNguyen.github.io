## Data Science Projects

### [Prostate Cancer Diagnosis, Kaggle (April 2020 - Present)](https://www.kaggle.com/hannguyen/prostrate-cancer-detection)
Developed  a  [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)  neural  network  using  PyTorch  for  detecting  prostate  cancer tissues on  images  of prostate tissue samples and estimate severity of the disease using the most extensive multi-center dataset on Gleason grading yet available.

### [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets, Kaggle (January 2020 - March 2020)](https://github.com/HanDuyNguyen/Projects/blob/master/True%20or%20Fake%20news%20prediction/Embedding_and_LSTM.ipynb)
Built a two-layers Long Short-Term Memory neural network with an additional Embedding layer using TensorFlow/Keras to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. Achieved 81% accuracy on the test data.

### [XTX Market Forecasting Challengle, XTX Market (July 2019 - Septemper 2019)](https://github.com/HanDuyNguyen/Projects/blob/master/XTX%20Forecasting%20Challenge/XTX_XGBoost.ipynb)
Built an XGBoost model by using scikit-learn library to predict stock movement based on the real-market order book data. Achieved 8% mean square error (MSE) on the test data.
