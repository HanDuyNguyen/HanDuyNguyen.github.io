## Data Science Projects

### [Prostate Cancer Diagnosis, Kaggle (April 2020 - Present)](https://www.kaggle.com/hannguyen/prostrate-cancer-detection)
Developed  a  [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)  neural  network  using  PyTorch  for  detecting  prostate  cancer tissues on  images  of prostate tissue samples and estimate severity of the disease using the most extensive multi-center dataset on Gleason grading yet available.

### [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets, Kaggle (January 2020 - March 2020)](https://github.com/HanDuyNguyen/Projects/blob/master/True%20or%20Fake%20news%20prediction/Embedding_and_LSTM.ipynb)
Built a two-layers Long Short-Term Memory neural network with an additional Embedding layer using TensorFlow/Keras to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which ones are no. Achieved 81% accuracy on the test data.



### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/HanDuyNguyen/HanDuyNguyen.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
